## Softskill Assessment Strategy

The soft skills that i have involved in this project is testing the intelligence, logical thinking , vision and building curiosity in users.

## Logic

In this project there will be 5 questions in a sequence which will be correct if the user finds the clues and solve questions correctly then he will be directed to treasure .If he answers incorrectly in any of the questions in between then they will be redirected to wrong questions and they may think that they are in correct track but they will get into retry page and if user also answers wrong in that path also then they are defeated.
